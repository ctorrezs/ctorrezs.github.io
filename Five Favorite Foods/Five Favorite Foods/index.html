                <h2>Philly Cheesesteak</h2>
                <p>My first cheesesteak was from Charleys Cheesesteaks, and I thought it was really good. However, my little brother likes to cook, and when he made his own, it made Charleys Cheesesteaks look bad in comparison.</p>

                <h2>Lasagna Fritta</h2>
                <p>The Lasagna Fritta from Olive Garden is just labeled as an appetizer, but everytime we went I would always buy it as my main meal. The only complain I have is that they dont give you more per plate.</p>

                <h2>Lentils</h2>
                <p>My Mom makes the best Lentils hands down, and the best part is that she makes so much it feels endless. No image on the internet looks half as good as hers, so I just choose a raw lentils image.</p>

                <h2>Enchiladas Suizas</h2>
                <p>These are my favorite type of enchiladas. You can save the leftovers in the fridge, so they come in handy whenever I'm in a rush. Just heat them up in the microwave for a bit, and they're ready to go.</p>

                <h2>Original Pan Cheese Pizza</h2>
                <p>When I was younger, I used to be very picky with my foodâ€”I didn't even like pepperoni on my pizza, so I would order just cheese. I could eat an entire Original Pan pizza from Pizza Hut by myself after getting home from school.</p>
