            <h1>An Introduction to R.E.P.O</h1>
            <p>R.E.P.O. (short for Retrieve, Extract & Profit Operation) is an online cooperative survival horror game with built-in voice chat. It supports up to six players working together to explore eerie, monster-infested locations, recover valuable objects, and bring them to extraction points while avoiding or managing encounters with threatening creatures.</p>
            <p>The twist is that everything is physics-based: you literally have to lift, carry, drag, and maneuver objects through hazardous terrain without breaking them (damaged objects lose value). The game also features roguelike elements and procedural generation, meaning layouts, enemy placements, and item positions change every run to keep things unpredictable.</p>
            <p>Between runs, players spend the in-game currency (“SURPLUS”) on upgrades, weapons, tools, and enhancements to improve their chances on future missions. R.E.P.O. blends horror tension with chaotic physics-based gameplay, where silence, careful coordination, and handling objects delicately are as critical as dodging monsters.</p>
